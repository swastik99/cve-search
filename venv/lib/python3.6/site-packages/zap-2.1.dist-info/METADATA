ZAP (the Zurich Atmosphere Purge)
---------------------------------

Tired of sky subtraction residuals? ZAP them!

ZAP is a high precision sky subtraction tool which can be used as complete sky
subtraction solution, or as an enhancement to previously sky-subtracted MUSE
data.  The method uses PCA to isolate the residual sky subtraction features and
remove them from the observed datacube. Future developments will include
modification for use on a variety of instruments.

The last stable release of ZAP can be installed simply with pip::

    pip install zap

Or into the user path with::

    pip install --user zap

2.1 (2019-07-03)
----------------

- Zap now requires Python 3.5 or later, and Astropy 2.0 or later.

- Compatibility with the NFM-AO mode.

- Ignore the notch filter region in the 'median' and 'fit' methods for the
  continuum filter (``cftype``).

- Change the default continuum filter method (``cftype``) to 'median' and
  remove the 'weight' method. The previous default method ('weight') has some
  problems with the treatment of spectra edges and with the notch filter edges
  for the AO modes, and is also introducing bumps in the red wavelengths.

- Add a command-line argument for ``nevals``.

- Scipy 0.18.1 or later is required, because of SVD convergence issue with
  previous versions.

- Add a function to mask the cube edges (``zap.mask_nan_edges``): the spaxels
  at the edges of the cube may have a lot of NaNs in their spectra, so ZAP
  does not subtract the sky on these which leaves high residuals.


2.0 (2017-09-08)
----------------

- Compatibility with the WFM-AO mode.

- Use `Scikit-learn`_'s implementation for the PCA instead of the custom one.
  This solved an issue with spatial variations introduced by zap. Also it is
  much faster than the previous implementation. A drawback however is that it is
  no more possible to save the SVD file.

- Use only one *sky segment* by default, which means that the cube is
  no more split on the wavelength axis. Originally zap used 11 segments, whose
  goals were to have coherent groups of sky emission lines, with a smaller
  number of eigenvalues per segment. And it also allowed to parallelize the
  computation. But, the segments were also responsible for continuum
  oscillations, and made the choice of the number of eigenvalues per segment
  very difficult and very sensitive. With only one segment the performance of
  the sky subtraction is much better, thanks to the higher correlation between
  sky lines on the whole wavelength range.

  So using only one segment allows to greatly reduce the risk of killing an
  emission line with the new PCA. It is still possible to modify the segments if
  needed::

      from zap.zap import SKYSEG
      SKYSEG[:] = [0, 5400, ..., 10000]

- New continuum filter type with a polynomial fit (``cftype='fit'``). Must be
  used with care though, as the fit can easily go out of control in the red part
  of the spectrum.

- Change the default median filter width to 300, for the ``median`` and
  ``weight`` continuum filters. The values used previously, 100 and 50, were too
  small which explains the background oscillations in the red part of the
  spectra.

- New parameter (``ncpu``) to set the number of used CPU.

- Remove the possibility to save the SVD result in a FITS file. This is because
  of the change of PCA implementation. It is still possible to pass the SVD
  computed by ``SVDoutput`` to ``process``, passing the in-memory object
  directly without saving it to disk.

- Speed improvements, mostly thanks to the new PCA implementation.

- New parameter to save the explained variance curves.


1.0 (2016-04-02)
