The underlying cause is application functionality using predictable URL/form actions in a repeatable way. The nature of the attack is that CSRF exploits the trust that a web site has for a user. By contrast, cross-site scripting (XSS) exploits the trust that a user has for a web site. Like XSS, CSRF attacks are not necessarily cross-site, but they can be. Cross-site request forgery is also known as CSRF, XSRF, one-click attack, session riding, confused deputy, and sea surf.<\/p><p><\/p><p>CSRF attacks are effective in a number of situations, including:<\/p><p>    * The victim has an active session on the target site.<\/p><p>    * The victim is authenticated via HTTP auth on the target site.<\/p><p>    * The victim is on the same local network as the target site.<\/p><p><\/p><p>CSRF has primarily been used to perform an action against a target site using the victim's privileges, but recent techniques have been discovered to disclose information by gaining access to the response.

A browser instance can be a standard web browser client, or a browser object embedded in a software product such as the browser within WinAmp, an RSS reader, or an email client. The code itself is usually written in HTML/JavaScript, but may also extend to VBScript, ActiveX, Java, Flash, or any other browser-supported technology.<\/p><p>When an attacker gets a user's browser to execute his/her code, the code will run within the security context (or zone) of the hosting web site. With this level of privilege, the code has the ability to read, modify and transmit any sensitive data accessible by the browser. A Cross-site Scripted user could have his/her account hijacked (cookie theft), their browser redirected to another location, or possibly shown fraudulent content delivered by the web site they are visiting. Cross-site Scripting attacks essentially compromise the trust relationship between a user and the web site. Applications utilizing browser object instances which load content from the file system may execute code under the local machine zone allowing for system compromise.<\/p><p><\/p><p>There are three types of Cross-site Scripting attacks: non-persistent, persistent and DOM-based.<\/p><p>Non-persistent attacks and DOM-based attacks require a user to either visit a specially crafted link laced with malicious code, or visit a malicious web page containing a web form, which when posted to the vulnerable site, will mount the attack. Using a malicious form will oftentimes take place when the vulnerable resource only accepts HTTP POST requests. In such a case, the form can be submitted automatically, without the victim's knowledge (e.g. by using JavaScript). Upon clicking on the malicious link or submitting the malicious form, the XSS payload will get echoed back and will get interpreted by the user's browser and execute. Another technique to send almost arbitrary requests (GET and POST) is by using an embedded client, such as Adobe Flash.<\/p><p>Persistent attacks occur when the malicious code is submitted to a web site where it's stored for a period of time. Examples of an attacker's favorite targets often include message board posts, web mail messages, and web chat software.

Although most popular web servers will prevent this technique from escaping the web document root, alternate encodings of the \"../\" sequence may help bypass the security filters. These method variations include valid and invalid Unicode-encoding (\"..%u2216\" or \"..%c0%af\") of the forward slash character, backslash characters (\"..\\\") on Windows-based servers, URL encoded characters \"%2e%2e%2f\"), and double URL encoding (\"..%255c\") of the backslash character.<\/p><p><\/p><p>Even if the web server properly restricts Path Traversal attempts in the URL path, a web application itself may still be vulnerable due to improper handling of user-supplied input. This is a common problem of web applications that use template mechanisms or load static text from files. In variations of the attack, the original URL parameter value is substituted with the file name of one of the web application's dynamic scripts. Consequently, the results can reveal source code because the file is interpreted as text instead of an executable script. These techniques often employ additional special characters such as the dot (\".\") to reveal the listing of the current working directory, or \"%00\" NULL characters in order to bypass rudimentary file extension checks.<\/p>","instances":[{"uri":"http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/attack?Screen=attack&menu=600","method":"POST","param":"Screen","attack":"attack"},{"uri":"http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/attack?Screen=160587164&menu=200","method":"POST","param":"password","attack":"attack"},{"uri":"http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/attack?Screen=attack&menu=200","method":"POST","param":"Screen","attack":"attack"},{"uri":"http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/attack?Screen=231255157&menu=attack","method":"POST","param":"menu","attack":"attack"},{"uri":"http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/attack?Screen=160587164&menu=attack&stage=2","method":"POST","param":"menu","attack":"attack"},{"uri":"http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/attack?Screen=736032128&menu=600","method":"POST","param":"first_name","attack":"attack"},{"uri":"http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/attack?Screen=736032128&menu=600","method":"POST","param":"room_no","attack":"attack"},{"uri":"http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/attack?Screen=231255157&menu=200","method":"POST","param":"SUBMIT","attack":"attack"},{"uri":"http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/attack?Screen=1426618575&menu=400","method":"POST","param":"price2Submit","attack":"attack"},{"uri":"http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/attack?Screen=231255157&menu=200","method":"POST","param":"File","attack":"/attack"},{"uri":"http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/attack?Screen=2000980640&menu=400","method":"POST","param":"checkbox","attack":"attack"},{"uri":"http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/attack?Screen=160587164&menu=200","method":"POST","param":"action","attack":"attack"},{"uri":"http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/attack?Screen=1863884331&menu=1700","method":"POST","param":"Price","attack":"attack"},{"uri":"http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/attack?Screen=1426618575&menu=400&from=attack&TRAVEL_FROM=BOS&TRAVEL_TO=SEA","method":"GET","param":"from","attack":"attack"},{"uri":"http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/attack?Screen=1426618575&menu=400","method":"POST","param":"price2Submit","attack":"\\attack"},{"uri":"http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/attack?Screen=160587164&menu=200&stage=2","method":"POST","param":"employee_id","attack":"attack"}],"count":"16","solution":"<p>Assume all input is malicious.

A browser instance can be a standard web browser client, or a browser object embedded in a software product such as the browser within WinAmp, an RSS reader, or an email client. The code itself is usually written in HTML/JavaScript, but may also extend to VBScript, ActiveX, Java, Flash, or any other browser-supported technology.<\/p><p>When an attacker gets a user's browser to execute his/her code, the code will run within the security context (or zone) of the hosting web site.

A Cross-site Scripted user could have his/her account hijacked (cookie theft), their browser redirected to another location, or possibly shown fraudulent content delivered by the web site they are visiting. Cross-site Scripting attacks essentially compromise the trust relationship between a user and the web site.

In such a case, the form can be submitted automatically, without the victim's knowledge (e.g. by using JavaScript). Upon clicking on the malicious link or submitting the malicious form, the XSS payload will get echoed back and will get interpreted by the user's browser and execute.
